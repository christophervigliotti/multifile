# jQuery MultiFile Implementation

## Goal

Implement a multi select where users can select one file at a time (then upload them all at once)

## Customizations

* Submit button is disabled unless one or more files are queued for upload.
* Submit button displays the number of files that will be uploaded.
* Non-customizable `<input type="file"> ` field is replaced by a button.

## More
