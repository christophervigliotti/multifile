# jQuery MultiFile Implementation

## Goal

* implement a multi select where users can select one file at a time (then upload them all at once)

## Customizations

* disabled submit button unless one or more files are selected
* submit button displays the number of files that will be uploaded
* ugly file fields (whose text you cannot control) is replaced by a "add file to upload queue"

## More
